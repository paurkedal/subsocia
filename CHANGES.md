## v0.22.0 - 2025-10-06

  - Fixed `Subsocia_direct.transaction` and added missing transaction scopes
    to `subsocia` subcommands which modify the database.
  - The `subsocia delete` command now has `-d` and `-r` options to allow
    stripping inclusions and attributes in the same operation that the
    entity is deleted.
  - The enforcement time for inclusions can now be specified in schema files
    with the new `%from` attribute after inclusion constraints.  The default
    enforcement time can now also be provided by passing `--time` to the
    `load`, `create`, and `db-init` subcommands.

## v0.21.0 - 2023-09-19

  - Upgrade to Caqti 2.0.

## v0.20.0 - 2023-03-28

Library:

  - Switch configuration to JSON with Yojson extensions.
  - Extend the entity interface with `unique_mapping1`,
    `unique_relations_by_image`, and `unique_relations_by_preimage`.
  - Add `Relation.True`.
  - Use `logs` instead of `lwt_log`.
  - Use SQL triggers for maintaining ranks (schema version 6).
  - Register pretty-printer for exception.

Utility:

  - Remove space at end of line for in-list output.
  - Add `--disable-core-schema` to `db-init` subcommand. The root entity
    will still be created, as this is now done by the SQL schema.
  - Fix misleading metavariables in an-allow and an-disallow documentation.

Internal:

  - Various test improvements.
  - Replace `Caqti_lwt_sql_io` with Angstrom parser.
  - Fix other deprecations and breakage for recent caqti, cmdliner, extunix.
  - Simplify select for `is_sub` when `?time` provided.

The project license now uses the LGPL-3.0 Linking Exception.

## v0.19.0 - 2020-06-11

    a given time or providing the full inclusion history of an entity.
  - The optimisation of recording subsumption of inclusion in the DB is
    dropped.
  - Extended transactional signature to `Subsocia_intf.S_SOID`.
  - Fixed inversion of exit code for bool-returning subcommands.
  - Improved documentation of entity-subcommands.

  corresponding changes to some function signatures and the `Set` and `Map`
  modules.

  `Subsocia_derived_intf.ATTRIBUTE_TYPE` has
  been replaced by `coerce_any`, `any_of_name_exn`, `of_name_exn` from
  `Subsocia_intf.ATTRIBUTE_TYPE`.
- `Subsocia_intf.ATTRIBUTE_TYPE.of_name` has been replaced by `of_name_exn`.
